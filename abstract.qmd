This study analyzes cancer mortality patterns in Multnomah County,
Oregon, from 2014 to 2023, utilizing death records filtered for
cancer-related primary causes as defined by ICD-10 codes. Data were
aggregated by age group, sex, year of death, and cancer site, with
population-adjusted mortality rates calculated using TidyCensus data.
These findings align with evolutionary theories framing cancer as a
disease of post-reproductive life stages, where weakened selection
pressures and aging tissue landscapes permit oncogenic evolution. The
analysis focused on the six most prevalent cancers—prostate, lung,
breast, colon, pancreas, and liver—assessing trends by demographic
factors and over time. Results reveal that cancer mortality rates
increase substantially with age, particularly among individuals over 55,
and are highest in those above 85. For cancers not specific to sex, no
statistically significant differences in mortality rates were observed
between males and females. While breast and lung cancers showed some
year-to-year variation in mortality rates, these fluctuations were not
consistent or significant across the decade. Prostate and pancreas
cancer mortality rates were also primarily influenced by age, not sex or
year. Overall, age was the dominant risk factor for cancer mortality,
with minimal influence from sex or year of death for the major cancer
types studied. These findings underscore the importance of age-targeted
cancer prevention and intervention strategies in Multnomah County.
