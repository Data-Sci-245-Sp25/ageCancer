    "text": "This study analyzes cancer mortality patterns in Multnomah County, Oregon, from 2014 to 2023, utilizing death records filtered for cancer-related primary causes as defined by ICD-10 codes. Data were aggregated by age group, sex, year of death, and cancer site, with population-adjusted mortality rates calculated using TidyCensus data. These findings align with evolutionary theories framing cancer as a disease of post-reproductive life stages, where weakened selection pressures and aging tissue landscapes permit oncogenic evolution. The analysis focused on the six most prevalent cancers—prostate, lung, breast, colon, pancreas, and liver—assessing trends by demographic factors and over time. Results reveal that cancer mortality rates increase substantially with age, particularly among individuals over 55, and are highest in those above 85. For cancers not specific to sex, no statistically significant differences in mortality rates were observed between males and females. While breast and lung cancers showed some year-to-year variation in mortality rates, these fluctuations were not consistent or significant across the decade. Prostate and pancreas cancer mortality rates were also primarily influenced by age, not sex or year. Overall, age was the dominant risk factor for cancer mortality, with minimal influence from sex or year of death for the major cancer types studied. These findings underscore the importance of age-targeted cancer prevention and intervention strategies in Multnomah County.\nSources:\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41416-019-0721-1\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6917346/",

    "text": "Cancer remains a leading cause of mortality in the United States, with significant variation in incidence and death rates across regions, age groups, and cancer types. Multnomah County, which includes Portland, Oregon, has experienced notable cancer-related mortality over the past decade. Cancer’s predominance in older age groups aligns with evolutionary theories positing that oncogenic processes are shaped by weakening selection pressures after reproductive maturity(1). The “post-reproductive genotype” hypothesis suggests that natural selection invests less in somatic maintenance and anticancer mechanisms once reproduction concludes, as mutations impacting fitness post-reproduction face minimal evolutionary constraint(1).The observed rise in cancer mortality with age in Multnomah County particularly among those over 55 mirrors broader evolutionary patterns.\nUnderstanding the demographic and temporal patterns of cancer deaths is crucial for public health planning and targeted interventions.To address this, researchers accessed comprehensive mortality data from the Multnomah County Health Department, in collaboration with Lewis and Clark College. The analysis focused on cancer as the primary cause of death, using ICD-10 codes to classify cancer types and aggregating data from 2014 to 2023. The study examined age, sex, year of death, and cancer site, with population data from TidyCensus enabling calculation of age-specific cancer mortality rates. By identifying trends and risk factors in the county’s cancer deaths, the research aims to inform local health strategies and resource allocation.",
